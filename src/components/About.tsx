          I'm so glad you asked. I am currently a rising junior (Class of '23)
          studying Computer Science at the University of Florida. As of Spring
          '21, my GPA is 3.96.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to a Bachelor's in CS, I am also pursuing a Minor in
          Spanish and a Certificate in AI Fundamentals and Applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I am very excited to say that I will be interning at Amazon this
          summer!
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be working in Denver as a Software Development Engineer (SDE)
          and I cannot wait! In fact, part of the reason for building this
          website is to prepare for the internship.

          For me, there is something special about creating software from
          scratch. I have always loved technology, and as a consumer I love
          intuitive interfaces and heavily customizable software.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what led me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. My
          goal is to make software that has a positive impact on customers,
          adding convenience to their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love problem solvingâ€” and there is plenty of that to be done in
          this field!

          While my spare time does involve a lot of coding (i.e. this website),
          there's more to the story.

          While I could talk forever about Lego sets, I'll instead just provide
          a brief overview of my hobbies.
