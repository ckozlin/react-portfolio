        <p>
          I'm so glad you asked. I am currently a rising junior studying
          Computer Science at the University of Florida. I have a 3.95 GPA
          overall, and a 3.97 in major-specific courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The past two summers (2021 & 2022), I interned with Amazon Web
          Services in Denver as a Software Development Engineer.

        <h3 className="ui header">Why Software Engineering?</h3>
        <p>
          For me, there is something special about creating software from
          scratch. I have always loved technology, and as a consumer I love
          intuitive interfaces and heavily customizable software.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what led me to pursue a career in Software Engineering. My
          goal is to make software that has a positive impact on customers,
          adding convenience to their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love problem solvingâ€” and there is plenty of that to be done in
          this field!

        <p>
          While my spare time does involve a lot of coding (i.e. this website),
          there's more to the story.

          While I could talk forever about Lego sets, I'll instead just provide
          a brief overview of my hobbies.
